# This YAML file contains crucial calibrations for the robot.                               #
# Any modifications should be carefully reviewed and validated.                             #
# Incorrect settings can lead to unexpected behavior or damage to the equipment.            #

# Once adjustments are made, ensure that all team members are informed.                     #
# Please proceed with caution.                                                              #
